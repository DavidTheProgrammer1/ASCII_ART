#Basic ASCII Art Generator

Execute the file, then it should ask you: 
```
file name: 
```
enter the name of the image, for example
```
image2.jpg
```
then it asks you how much letters on the x and y axis it should be,

I recommend The proportion X:Y 5:2 for square shaped images.

Then just wait, itll generate the ASCII text file.
